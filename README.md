# Stochastic-transit-optimization
## Goal 
A minimal stochastic transit simulation using Event-Activity Networks (EAN) and a linear delay management model (TDM-B). 

## Scope
- <= 8 stations
- Event-level delay propagation
- Monte Carlo evaluation
- LP-based wait-depart decisions

## Non-Goals
- No real city data
- No GUI system
- No large-scale optimization
